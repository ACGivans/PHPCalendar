# PHPCalendar
Calendar Reservation System.

Starting in the office hour set up file, the user is asked to select the times and days they would like to reserve. Upon submitting thier choices for the time and weekday, the data is passed to the calendar.php file where a calendar is generated based on the current month. Within each day the user selected, the timeslots they chose show up next to radio buttons. The user is then prompted to enter thier name, email, and to select a specific day from the displayed calendar using the radio buttons. Once submitted, the form states that the reservation was successfully submitted and an email is sent confirming thier appointment. Additionally, a hidden field containing the faculty email is used to send an email informing them of the meeting.
